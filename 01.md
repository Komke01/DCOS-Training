    * Git
    * Vagrant
    * others as necessary

* for all config files and others, make sure that you use unix style line ending in Notepad++

# 02 Why Mesos, DC/OS?
* cluster manager
* two level scheduler
* support for long running jobs
* 

## Outline
* Configuration Management and the problems with scale
* Distributed computing
* Virtualization
* Isolation through containerization
* Linux containers are lightweight and fast
* Microservices
* Container lifecycle management
* Container use cases - for development and deployment
* Build - Ship - Deploy
* Vagrant wraps a convenient API around orchestration tools
* Mesos works with containers from the ground up
    * does for containers what windows does for .exe and .dll files
* DC/OS builds on top of Mesos to provide capabilities for managing an entire datacenter
    * uses a YAML based configuration file on top of Vagrant


# 03 Vagrant Up
## Why and What 

### Vagrant terms

## Hands On: Vagrant, a quick look at the Vagrant file

* To create a sample VagrantFile, run:

```shell
vagrant init
```

* **precise*32*** and **precise*64*** are very commonly used boxes.

* Run:
```shell
vagrant box add hashicorp/precise32
```


* look them up on Vagrant Atlas, let's modify the VagrantFile:

``` shell
VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = "2"
Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|
  config.vm.box = "hashicorp/precise32"
  end
```


single machine
hierarchical clusters


# 04 Hands On: Setup a DC/OS cluster locally
We'll use: https://github.com/dcos/dcos-vagrant/

Install the vagrant hostmanager plugin: 

```shell
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
```
